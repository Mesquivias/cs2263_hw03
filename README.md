Homework #3 for CS226



## Description
We will be creating a small GUI application using JavaFX. Learning to use JavaFX and GSON was incredibly challenging. Yet it was rewarding to see the small application that I made start to work. 



## Usage
To use, simply type "gradle run" in the command line and then the Course Editor window will open. The user can select a department, enter a class name, class code, and number of credits. These text entries will be saved onto the table in the window when the "Enter" button is clicked. 

If the user wishes to save their selection of classes to a JSON file, they must simply click the "Save" button. 

The "Quit" button will close the window.

When the user runs the application again, they can load their previous table if they saved it using the "Load" button.
